You rarely come across standout talent like Syed Azhar. A very few people have the opportunity to work and report to a manager who is also a coach and a mentor. I had the pleasure of working with him since the beginning of my career, and I was lucky enough to have experienced this opportunity in my career time and again.

I worked for Azhar most recently at Careem collaborating on several team projects including, accelerating the process of product delivery by implementing DevOps and Agile practices across product development teams, cloud infrastructure management and automating software development, testing, and delivery lifecycles. I was always impressed with Azhar's ability to command a room and get people on board with ideas, even people who were initially on completely different pages. No matter how tense the meeting was, Azhar made sure that everyone left with a smile.

Surely, Azhar has my highest recommendation for any organization who wants to have him on board as a team member or a leader.You rarely come across standout talent like Syed Azhar.
